# hello-world
The compulsory/introductory 'hello-world' tutorial :)

What? I'm learning...

I'm a student (even though I'm almost 40) and looking at a career change from test-engineer to software developer.
Hopefully, someday...

I like JS, Java, PHP and PostgrSQL, And HTML. And Stephen King's books, too!
